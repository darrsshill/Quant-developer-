1️⃣ RETURN & PORTFOLIO MODELS
These are core for asset management & quant trading.
🔹 Mean-Variance Optimization
From Harry Markowitz
Known as:

Markowitz portfolio theory
Used for:
• Efficient frontier
• Portfolio construction
• Risk minimization
Very foundational.

🔹 CAPM
From William Sharpe
Capital Asset Pricing Model
Used to estimate:
• Expected return
• Beta
• Cost of equity
Still widely taught, simplified in practice.

🔹 Fama-French Factor Models
Eugene Fama
Kenneth French
Models:
• 3-Factor
• 5-Factor
Used heavily in:
Asset management & factor investing.

🔥 2️⃣ TIME SERIES MODELS (Very Important for Trading)
🔹 ARIMA
Used for:
• Forecasting returns
• Short-term predictions
🔹 GARCH
Used for:
• Volatility forecasting
Very widely used in:
• Risk desks
• VaR systems

🔹 Kalman Filter
Used for:
• Statistical arbitrage
• Dynamic beta estimation
• State-space models
Advanced but powerful.

🔥 3️⃣ DERIVATIVES MODELS
Very important for quant roles.
🔹 Black-Scholes Model
Developed by:
Fischer Black
Myron Scholes
Robert Merton
Black-Scholes model
Used to:
• Price European options
• Compute Greeks
• Implied volatility
Still industry standard baseline.

🔹 Binomial Tree Model
Used for:
• American options
• Discrete-time pricing
🔹 Monte Carlo Simulation
Used for:
• Exotic options
• Path-dependent derivatives
• Risk modeling
Very important in practice.

🔥 4️⃣ INTEREST RATE MODELS
Used in fixed income desks.
🔹 Vasicek Model
Vasicek model
Mean-reverting rate model.
🔹 CIR Model
Cox–Ingersoll–Ross model.
Used for:
• Bond pricing
• Rate derivatives

🔥 5️⃣ RISK MODELS
Used in banks & hedge funds.
🔹 Value at Risk (VaR)
Types:
• Parametric
• Historical
• Monte Carlo
Standard risk metric.

🔹 Expected Shortfall (CVaR)
More modern risk measure.
Used under Basel regulations.

🔥 6️⃣ MACHINE LEARNING MODELS (Modern Quant)
Now widely used in funds like:
Two Sigma
Citadel
Common models:
• Linear regression
• Logistic regression
• Random Forest
• XGBoost
• Neural networks
• LSTM for time series

But important:

ML does NOT replace financial theory.

🔥 7️⃣ STOCHASTIC MODELS (Advanced Quant)
🔹 Geometric Brownian Motion
Foundation of option pricing.
🔹 Heston Model
Stochastic volatility model.
Used in advanced option desks.

🧠 Important Reality
In real trading firms:
They don’t use one model.

They combine:

• Statistical models
• Risk models
• Execution models
• Machine learning

Layered together.

Now I’ll ask you something serious:
Do you want to specialize more in:

A) Portfolio & Asset Management
B) Options & Derivatives
C) Short-term Quant Trading
D) Fixed Income & Rates

Your answer changes your study path.
